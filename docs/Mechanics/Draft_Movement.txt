Behavior of walking at half tile width
Fully Aligned = in line with object
Half Aligned = half of character is in line with object

* events (characters) are collided with when fully & half aligned
* if tile (or events marked with a note) collided with from y-direction while half aligned, player should take one step around it
	e.g. walking up with half tree in front on left, whole passable space in front on right, player should move right by one

NOT IMPLEMENTED:

* player should be able to walk upwards to tile (& events marked with note) within half tile
	e.g. tree tile on y=10, player can walk on y=11 & y=10.5 but can't go up to y=10
