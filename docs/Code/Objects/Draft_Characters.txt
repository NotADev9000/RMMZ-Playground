== Objects that are displayed on the map with a sprite. These classes handle all related information such as, position, sprites, movement, interaction, collision and movement.

Char_Base:
- X/Y: Unit = Tiles
How far char is from edge (left/top) of screen.
When moving: for each movement step (1 tile or 0.5 tiles) this represents where the character is going to be.
When still: equal to RealX/Y
e.g. if x = 6 & char moves left once, x immediately goes to 5.5 (w/ altMovement)

- RealX/Y: Unit = Tiles
How far char is from edge (left/top) of screen.
When moving: represents where the sprite is. if this value != X/Y, each frame it will change towards X/Y depending on the chars movement speed.
When still: equal to X/Y
e.g. if X = 6 and RealX = 7, each frame RealX will decrease until it gets <= X. If RealX goes below X, it will be set to X.

- ScrolledX/Y: Unit = Tiles
How far char is from edge (left/top) of screen.
This includes the non-game areas for maps that are smaller than screen size.

- ScreenX/Y: Unit = Pixels
How far char is from edge (left/top) of screen to the center(x)/bottom(y) of the char.
